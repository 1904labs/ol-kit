The docs are organized into components and you will find utilities next to their corresponding components. We hope you find these docs helpful as you use ol-kit. Feel free to submit a PR on Github if you find a mistake or have an idea to improve the docs

Conventions
===========

Whenever an OpenLayers object is referenced it is prefixed with `ol.` to denote it is not an ol-kit object. To learn more about an OpenLayers object type you can head over to their excellent [API docs](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/index.html) and search for the object type, replacing all `.` with `/`.
